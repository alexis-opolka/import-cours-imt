## How to answer "Tell me about yourself" question? By [LetThemTalk](https://www.youtube.com/@LetThemTalkTV)

If you possess the art of conversation
See what you're like as a candidate

Steps:

- Some adjectives to describe yourself
- Professional background
- Some achievemnts
- Some knowledge about the company
- What I can do for you
- Show that I have a life outside of work (duh!)

Rules:

- Keep it brief (+5min is too long, preferrably 3-5min)
  
  => The end result should be "I want to know more" than "I know too much"

- Maintain good eye contact
- Don't have a monotone voice
- Speak informally
- Don't memorize answers

### My Pitch

I would describe myself as a hard-working, enthusiastic person who 
works well with others, and creative and open-minded when it comes to 
finding solutions.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to contribute to 
different projects both internal and publicly available which has allowed 
me to cultivate the ability to adapt myself quickly to the practices and
technologies used in a given work environment and work with many
different people all throughout the globe.

Some examples can give you are my student-entrepreneur status,
a project on  GitHub called Navi or
with the Rust Packaging Work Group of Debian
and some others that are still underway.

With all that, I believe these experiences makes me an ideal 
candidate for this position, the qualities you're searching for,
and more importantly, will allow me achieve the goals you have set
for the incoming hire for this position and for your project to continue to
thrive on.
